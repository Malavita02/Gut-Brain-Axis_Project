# Gut-Brain-Axis_Project
This repository contains the source code and supplementary materials for the Gut-Brain Axis and Taste Perception project. The project aims to investigate the relationship between the gut-brain axis, taste perception, and their underlying mechanisms.

### Contents
* Images: This directory contains four images related to the project, which are referenced in the paper.
* Paper: The paper directory contains the PDF version of the research paper detailing the experimental design, methodology, and findings.
* Pump_Controller_Example: This Python script (pump_controller_example.py) provides an example of integrating the pumps and microcontroller into the experimental paradigm. It demonstrates how to control the activation and deactivation of the pumps during the experiment.
* Experiment_Protocols: This directory includes two Python files (experiment_protocol_1.py and experiment_protocol_2.py) that represent the experiment protocols used in the study. These files incorporate the pump controller functionality into the experimental design.

### Usage
* The pump_controller_example.py file can be used as a reference for integrating the pump controller functionality into your own experimental paradigm.
* The experiment protocols (experiment_protocol_1.py and experiment_protocol_2.py) provide a starting point for conducting similar experiments with the pump controller implementation. You can modify these files according to your specific requirements and experimental design.

### Requirements
To run the scripts and utilize the pump controller functionality, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
* Python (version X.X.X)
* PsychoPy (version X.X.X)
* Serial library (for communication with the microcontroller)
* Arduino IDE (for uploading the code to the microcontroller)
