# Gut-Brain-Axis_Project
This repository contains the source code and supplementary materials for the project "Making tools to facilitate the study of the gut-brain axis". The project aims to develop a gustometer to be used during neurofunctional assays in humans (the Brain), in order to assist further developments in the comprehension of the gut and brain axis

## Contents
- **Images**: This directory contains four images related to the project, which are referenced in the paper.
- **Paper**: The paper directory contains the PDF version of the research paper detailing the experimental design, methodology, and findings.
- **Pump_Controller_Example**: This Python script (`pump_controller_example.py`) provides an example of integrating the pumps and microcontroller into the experimental paradigm. It demonstrates how to control the activation and deactivation of the pumps during the experiment.
- **Experiment_Protocols**: This directory includes two Python files (`stress_food_reward.py` and `stress_food_reward_lastrun.py`) that represent the experiment protocols used in the study. These files incorporate the pump controller functionality into the experimental design.

## Usage
- The `pump_controller_example.py` file can be used as a reference for integrating the pump controller functionality into a experimental paradigm.
- The experiment protocols (`stress_food_reward.py` and `stress_food_reward_lastrun.py`) provide a starting point for conducting similar experiments with the pump controller implementation. You can modify these files according to your specific requirements and experimental design.

## Requirements
To run the scripts and utilize the pump controller functionality, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
* Python 
* PsychoPy 
* Arduino IDE (for uploading the code to the microcontroller)
